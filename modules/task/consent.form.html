		            Dear Sir/Madam,
		            <br><br>
		            This questionnaire was developed by the Australian Sleep Trials Network and the Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) for Alertness, Safety and Productivity (http://www.alertnesscrc.com/). The CRC is a collaboration between the Australian Government working closely with industry partners and Australia’s top Universities and Research Institutes whose primary aim is to conduct cutting edge, quality research to develop innovative ways to improve sleep health, alertness, safety and productivity for all Australians. This important research is impossible without the generous contribution from volunteers, and as such we would like to invite you to contribute to this research effort designed to better understand and treat sleep disorders. We would be grateful if you would complete the following questionnaire as soon as possible prior to your scheduled sleep study. This questionnaire will take approximately 45 minutes to complete, which can be done in multiple sessions.  Please complete all sections unless it states that you are not required to do so.          <br><br>
		            <br>
		            Taking part in this research is completely voluntary and all information obtained in this questionnaire will be kept confidential and de-identified prior to any research use. Any research information will be de-identified and stored completely anonymously and separate from your personal information on a CRC database with the same high level of security as your personal medical record. Your information will not be provided to any third party unless required by law.        <br><br>
		            <br>
		            If you have any concerns or questions we encourage you to contact our research team on <label id=_phone ></label>  as early as possible prior to your study date.        <br><br>
		            <br>
